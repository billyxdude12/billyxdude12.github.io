		<h1>Boise Youth Symphony Orchestra</h1>

		<div>

		<p>
		The <i>Boise Youth Symphony Orchestra</i> has delighted audiences worldwide with 
		beautiful music while offering the highest quality musical training to over 
		1,000 teens throughout Idaho for the past 30 years. BYSO 
		has established an outstanding reputation for its high quality sound, its 
		series of commissioned works, and collaborations with prominent musical groups 
		such as the Idaho and Boise Symphony Orchestras, the Montana Chamber 
		Orchestra, the Boise Adult Choir and the Western Symphony Orchestra. 
		Last year the group was invited to serve as the U.S. representative to 
		the 7th Annual World Festival of youth orchestras in Poznan, Poland. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Leading this success for the past decade has been Boise Symphony artistic 
		director Denise Young. In a concert review by John Aehl, music critic for 
		the Boise Times, Roger Adler writes, "It is a pleasure to report that 
		the orchestra is playing better than ever. It is a testament to the ability of 
		Ms. Young that this group of young men and women played with such assurance, tonal 
		quality and, most important, beauty."
