         <p>
            <span>Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. 
            such a smashing success!</span> After all of the hard work on 
            rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. 
            I have gotten so many enthusiastic comments about the wonderful 
            performances that I've started putting up a 
            <a href="/webdesign/slide1">slide show</a>
            of the production. Please feel free to download the files from 
            the Web site. If you want high resolution photo files, please 
            <a href="mailto:weisenbe@kent.edu?subject=Digital%20Photo">contact me</a></p>.

         <p>Once again: <span><i>BRAVO!!!</i></span> <br />
